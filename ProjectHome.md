## Object-oriented CSS framework ##
**xCSS** bases on **CSS** and empowers a straightforward and object-oriented workflow when developing complex style cascades. Using **xCSS** means a dramatic cut down to your development time by: having a intuitive overview of the overall **CSS** structure, using variables, re-using existing style cascades and many other handy features. But, most frameworks are bulky and inflexible, aren't they? Not **xCSS**! It's lightweight and seamlessly integrates into any existing workflow. Aside from that the **CSS** overhead is getting reduced while your **(X)HTML** attributes remain semantic.
